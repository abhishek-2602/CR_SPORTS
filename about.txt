My name is Abhishek A, and I am currently pursuing my MCA. I have a strong interest in both data analytics and web development, and I recently completed a three-month online internship in data analytics. As part of my academic journey, I am working on a major project titled Customer Churn Analysis for the Telecom Industry using Python, SQL, and Power BI. Alongside this, I have also developed projects like an Event Management System and a website for a cricket academy, which helped me enhance my web development skills. I have practical knowledge of tools such as Python, SQL, Excel, Tableau, and Power BI, and I enjoy applying them to real-world datasets for meaningful insights. My learning path has also given me hands-on experience in data cleaning, visualization, and machine learning techniques. Apart from academics, I worked as a part-time cricket coach for three years, which strengthened my leadership, discipline, and teamwork abilities. I am passionate about continuous learning, problem-solving, and using technology to create impactful solutions.
